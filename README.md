# Termy

PKG **Termy** facilitates access to basic (terminal emulator's) functionality.

---

`termy.go` allows you to put your terminal in non-cooked modes.

`escapy.go` provides function to send in-band control sequences to your terminal.

TODO: I'll soon add capabilities for styles, colours, etc.
